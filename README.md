To implement a Python program that analyzes quadratic functions computes derivatives, identifies critical points, and visualizes the functions.
It is was our assignment, We were suppose to implement a python code by using the functions,using the python code to calculate derivatives, then make it on graph by using Sympy, matplotlib, during this assignment, we were working together a group to figure out the assignments, below you will see our ressources we used to find solution about the tasks they asked us to solve, before that We faced several problems beginning with the task 2 to task 4 because we were not ready well but after doing more research, we were able to solve the problem. As group we were working together and find the solution. Below this is the resources we used:
